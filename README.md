MK Udacity Frontend Nanodegree - Project 3: Arcade Game Clone
===============================

HOW TO RUN THE GAME:
--------------------
There isn't really that much to explain on how to run the game. A user simply has to open index.html in a webbrowser of their choice. In this HTML document all the JavaScript instructions are run. The canvas element is created and the gameboard and its contents initialized automatically.

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
--------------------
In order to play the game, a user has to press the arrow keys to move the player character on the field. Only the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) can be used to steer. No other keys have implemented functionality for the game.

When the player collides with an enemy, the player is reset to the start. This happens also when a player reaches the top row (the water) and thus succeeds in playing the game.

Have fun!
